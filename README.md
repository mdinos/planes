node project, clone to directory and type to go:

``` npm install ```

``` node server ```

then navigate to

``` http://127.0.0.1:3000 ```

to reach the server.

## main issues for this stage of development

Better security needed, sessions are currently fairly insecure.

## stuff that would be nice
 Better formatting of modules
 Each session is editable - this would involve another table in the database, with modId as a foreign key
 Editable button for each module
 Delete button for each module
 Finish other pages on the site
 Better session security - at present you can just edit your userid to log in as anyone
 In a similar veil, randomised userids rather than auto incremented from the SQL server
 Improved validation - server side rather than just client side - insecure and open to browser tinkering
 Exportable sessions/modules to HTML page.
